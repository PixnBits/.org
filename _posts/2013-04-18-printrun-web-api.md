I’ve contributed to the [Printrun project on GitHub](http://GitHub.com/kliment/Printrun) and have taken an interest in the web interface. Namely, I’d like to implement an API and a companion JS framework. I’ve got the JS bit started, but haven’t pushed yet due to code complexities in other files. A little bit of cleanup, and I’ll get it up :-)

Until then, I’m going to keep track of some uses for the API:

* Use a tablet/phone to control the machine via local LAN
  * (my commit introducing AJAX was a big speed-up)
  * Start an Android app (ambitious)
* [Trigger a callback when finished](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun/issues/301) (for cool bits like email/SMS)
