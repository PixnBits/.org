title: Speech Recognition
summary: “King Julian!”

Wanting to play with speech recognition software, I’ve found Sphinx and [Julius](http://julius.sourceforge.jp/en_index.php).

Sphinx runs, but refuses to give **any** feedback.

Julius is more finicky to get started. [This post](http://julius.sourceforge.jp/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=1507) seems to document some of my early attempts, and results.

I’ll be playing with them more.

(Found a reference to [Simon](http://sourceforge.net/projects/speech2text/), a GUI for this sort of thing. Hmmm…tempted, yes, if just to see the invocation…)
