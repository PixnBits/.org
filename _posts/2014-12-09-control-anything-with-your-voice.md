If you’re thinking it, 10,000 other are too. Of those, maybe 100 attempt and 1 succeeds.

The [Jasper Project](https://jasperproject.github.io/) is that one. Or getting closer, anyway.

While [in my own adventures](https://github.com/PixnBits/SimpleHomeAutomation) I resorted to Window’s built-in STT engine, I expect to use Jasper in the future.
