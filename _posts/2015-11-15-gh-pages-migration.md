summary: Moving hosting and site design
---

I'm kinda tired of wanting to write entries and having to remember one more password, so I'm migrating to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) instead.

Maybe now I'll take up the site designing that I've intended to do since my [first post](/articles/first-post).

[Update]
Oh, goodie: [Ruby has issues with timezones](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/1069#issuecomment-77661605). That means, instead of specifying my timezone in `_config.yml`, I have to add the offset in _every_ post.
